							<h1>KPOP <FONT COLOR="#E17F93">Overview</FONT></h1>
							<p>In this part of this site, I will be introducing what KPOP is for those who have no idea about it. Also, I will be sharing my opinions on people who dislike kpop with an unreasonable reason. Keep scrolling if you want to know these.</p>
							<hr />
							<span class="image main"><img src="kpop header.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>KPOP - the shortened form of the words "KOREAN POP". This genre of music is very well-known all through out the world. It is because of the widespread fans. If you see it this way, kpop is like a virus â€” a positive virus, where from one person to another, your love for this music and for the people behind it will increase.</p>
							<p>As you all know, in this world, not all people can like or would want to like kpop as it is. There are a number of people who backslash on kpop, or simply put, hate kpop. Some of their reasons include, "I can't understand them", "He looks gay", and "It'll just be a disturbance in my life". However, they see kpop differently from kpop fans.</p>
							<p>For me, as a kpop fan, these artists and their music has helped me overcome myself a lot. It is true that we don't really understand their language, but there is a reason why subtitles exist. If a man wears a make-up, that doesn't make them "gay", as they may not know, kpop artists appear a lot on screen, therefore, applying make-up from time to time
							helps them look good on screen as well. Not that I'm saying they do not look good in real life or without make-up. "KPOP is a complete distraction and disturbance". No. KPOP has healed many hearts, including mine. These artists that I mentioned, they made me smile. KPOP isn't bad, the people who think it is are.</p>

### Information

> I am Widmarc Kymm P. Guadalupe, the creator of this site. May I briefly introduce myself to my dear viewers. I am 15 of age and started getting into *KPOP* on the year 2016. As a kpop fan, I idolize many soloists and groups including **IU, AleXa, Seventeen, Treasure, TXT, Twice, Blackpink, ITZY, Red Velvet, Enhypen, STAYC, AESPA, and many many more.** 

> This site was created for my fellow *KPOP STANS* from many different fandoms. This is a way to unite with you all and set aside those fandom wars we see everywhere even for just this moment. 

> In this site you will be able to add more informations about groups you may know or may not know. I am also going to introduce here my favorite groups and soloists for you all to get to know me as well.
